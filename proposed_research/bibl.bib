	abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical, to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots. },

@article{axel_planning,
abstract = {This paper considers the motion planning problem that arises when a tethered robot descends and ascends steep obstacle-strewn terrain. This work is motivated by the Axel tethered robotic rover designed to provide access to extreme extra-planetary terrains. Motion planning for this type of rover is very different from traditional planning problems because the tether geometry under high loading must be considered during the planning process. Furthermore, only round-trip paths that avoid tether entanglement are viable solutions to the problem. We present an algorithm for tethered robot motion planning on steep terrain that reduces the likelihood that the tether will become entangled during descent and ascent of steep slopes. The algorithm builds upon the notion of the shortest homotopic tether path and its associated sleeve. We provide a simple example for purposes of illustration.},

@article{duaxel,
abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity’s initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

@article{axel_design,
abstract = {The recent discovery of bright new deposits in two crater gullies on Mars suggests that water still flows in brief spurts on Mars. In this paper, we will present the Axel rover (Figure 1) that was developed to access and sample such deposits on the inside of steep crater walls. Axel is a tethered rover that can be a payload on a lander or a larger rover. The primary features of Axel are its minimal complexity and robustness to the treacherous terrain of sites that are of scientific interest. Using a symmetrical design with three actuators, Axel is capable of operating upside down and right side up, enabling it to descend over crater promontories. With its actuated trailing link, Axel can operate on both flat and sloped terrains. Using a sampling device mounted on the trailing link, Axel can collect and store terrain samples and return to its host platform for detailed scientific sample analysis. We will present our preliminary results that demonstrated Axel's ability to traverse both flat and sloped rocky terrain including 90deg vertical cliffs and collecting soil samples on slopes ranging from 10deg - 40deg in the JPL Mars Yard.},

@article{dante_results,
abstract = {Dante II is a unique walking robot that provides important insight into high-mobility robotic locomotion and remote robotic exploration. Dante II's uniqueness   stems from its combined legged and rappelling mobility system, its scanning-laser rangefinder, and its multilevel control scheme. In 1994 Dante II was deployed and successfully tested in a remote Alaskan volcano, as a demonstration of the fieldworthiness of these technologies. For more than five days the robot explored  alone in the volcano crater using a combination of supervised autonomous control and teleoperated control. Human operators were located 120 km distant during the mission. This article first describes in detail the robot, support systems, control techniques, and user interfaces. We then describe results from the battery of field tests leading up to and including the volcanic mission. Finally, we put forth important lessons which comprise the legacy of this project. We show that  framewalkers are appropriate for rappelling in severe terrain, though tether systems have limitations. We also discuss the importance of future   "autonomous" systems to realize when they require human support rather than relying on humans for constant oversight.},

@article{lemur,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a multi-limbed robot in order to “free-climb ” vertical rock surfaces. Free-climbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might have future consequences. In this paper, this process of reasoning is broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a free-climbing robot’s configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact between the robot and its environment. A multi-step planning framework is presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called lemur (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at nasa-jpl). Using the planner presented in this paper, lemur free-climbed an indoor, near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features. 1},

@article{ties_that_bind,
abstract = {We consider the problem of motion planning for a number of small, circular robots in a common planar workspace. Each robot is tethered to a point on the boundary of the workspace by a flexible cable of finite length. These cables may be pushed and bent by robots that come in contact with them but remain taut at all times. The robots have a target point to reach on the workspace and, as each moves to its target, its cable gets stretched out into the workspace. For any set of target points, there may be many final cable configurations of differing complexity that allow all robots to reach their targets. Assuming a final configuration of the cables has been specified, the motion planning task addressed here is to produce reasonably short paths for the robots that will achieve this configuration. This is formulated as a problem in computational geometry and an O(n3 log n) algorithm is presented for achieving this task for n robots.},

@article{learning_biases,
abstract = {In this paper we present the projection and bias heuristic (PBH), a motion planning algorithm that makes use of low-dimensional projections to improve sampling-based planning algorithms. In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods, we do not assume that projections are either random or given by an expert user. Rather, our goal is to learn projections such that planning on them improves the efficiency and the quality of solutions. We present both, a method to learn effective projections and a sampling algorithm that makes use of them. We show that our approach can be easily integrated into popular sampling-based planners. Extensive experiments performed in simulated environments demonstrate that our approach produces paths that are in general shorter than those obtained with state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, it generally requires less computation time.},
