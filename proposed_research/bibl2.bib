@article{Kim2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we solve the path planning problem for a tethered mobile robot, which is connected to a fixed base by a cable of length L. The reachable space of the robot is restricted by the length of the cable and obstacles. The reachable space of the tethered robot can be computed by considering the topology class of the cable. However, it is computationally too expensive to compute this space a-priori. Instead, in this paper, we show how we can plan using a recently-developed variant of A* search, called Multi-Heuristic A*. Normally, the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm takes in a fixed set of heuristic functions. In our problem, however, the heuristics represent length of paths to the goal along different topology classes, and there can be too many of them and not all the topology classes are useful. To deal with this, we adapt Multi-Heuristic A* to work with a dynamically generated set of heuristic functions. It starts out as a normal weighted A*. Whenever the search gets trapped in a local minimum, we find the proper topology class of the path to escape from it and add the corresponding new heuristic function into the set of heuristic functions considered by the search. We present experimental analysis comparing our approach with weighted A* on planning for a tethered robot in simulation.},

@article{Minotaurs2015,
abstract = {Recently there has been surge of research in motion planning for tethered robots. In this problem a planar robot is connected via a cable of limited length to a fixed point in R2. The configuration space in this problem is more complicated than the one of a classic motion planning problem as existence of the cable causes additional constraints on the motion of the robot. In this thesis we are interested in finding a concise representation of the configuration space that results in a straightforward planning algorithm. To achieve such a representation we observe that configuration space manifold has a discrete structure that conveniently can be separated from its continuous aspect when it is represented as an atlas of charts. We provide a method for generating either the complete atlas or a subset of its charts based on special cable events. Generating parts of the configuration space on-the-fly enables the fol- lowing improvements over the state-of-the-art. a) We decompose the environment into cells as needed rather than an off-line global discretization, obtaining competi- tive time and space complexity for our planner. b)We are able to exploit topological structure to represent robot-cable configurations concisely leading us towards solu- tions to the more complex problems of interest. To underscore the potential of this representation, we take further steps to generalize it to two more complicated instances of the tethered robot planning problem that has been widely disregarded in the literature. We will first consider a simplified model of cable-to-cable contacts, giving the robot the option to perform knot-like ty- ing motions. Next, we will address the planning problem for a tethered robot whose cable has a constraint on its curvature. This adds to the realism of the model since most practical cables have some degree of stiffness which limits curvature. In this case we provide a novel technique to relate Dubins’ theory of curves with work on planning with topological constraints. Our results show the efficiency of the method and indicate further promise for procedures that represent manifolds via an amalga- mation of implicit discrete topological structure and explicit Euclidean cells.},

@article{duaxel,
abstract = {The recent discovery of bright new deposits in two crater gullies on Mars suggests that water still flows in brief spurts on Mars. In this paper, we will present the Axel rover (Figure 1) that was developed to access and sample such deposits on the inside of steep crater walls. Axel is a tethered rover that can be a payload on a lander or a larger rover. The primary features of Axel are its minimal complexity and robustness to the treacherous terrain of sites that are of scientific interest. Using a symmetrical design with three actuators, Axel is capable of operating upside down and right side up, enabling it to descend over crater promontories. With its actuated trailing link, Axel can operate on both flat and sloped terrains. Using a sampling device mounted on the trailing link, Axel can collect and store terrain samples and return to its host platform for detailed scientific sample analysis. We will present our preliminary results that demonstrated Axel's ability to traverse both flat and sloped rocky terrain including 90deg vertical cliffs and collecting soil samples on slopes ranging from 10deg - 40deg in the JPL Mars Yard.},

@article{Salzman2015,
abstract = {We study the problem of planning the shortest path for a polygonal robot anchored to a fixed base point by a finite tether translating among polygonal obstacles in the plane. Specifically, we preprocess the workspace to efficiently answer queries of the following type: Given a source location of the robot and an initial configuration of the tether, compute the shortest path to reach a target location while avoiding obstacles and adhering to the tether's constraints. Our work is an extension of the recent work by Kim et al. [1] who considered the problem for a point robot. Their algorithm relies on a discretization of the workspace and is optimal with respect to this discretization. We first replace their grid-based approach with a visibility-graph based approach. This allows to improve the running time of their algorithm by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, testing on a scenario similar to one presented by Kim et al., the running time is improved by a factor of more than 500. Moreover, our approach, which plans optimal paths, is applicable to polygonal (translating) robots and can be used to plan a shortest path while ensuring a predefined clearance from the obstacles. We report on our experimental results on a variety of scenarios. In all cases the preprocessing time is less than one second on a standard-commodity laptop, and a typical query takes several tens of miliseconds.},

@article{Shnaps2014,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with an online tethered coverage (TC), in which a mobile robot of size D is attached to a fixed point S by a cable of finite length L. Starting at S, the robot has to cover an unknown planar environment that contains obstacles and return to S with the cable fully retracted. The paper first establishes an optimal offline TC methodology, then introduces the TC algorithm that performs an online TC using position and local obstacle detection sensors. The performance of the TC algorithm is measured by its competitiveness, determined by measuring its total online path length l relative to the optimal offline solution lopt . The paper establishes that the TC algorithm has a competitive performance of l ≤ 2 L/D lopt. The paper additionally establishes a lower bound of l ≥ log(L/D) lopt over a generic family of TC algorithms of which the TC algorithm is a special case. Execution example and experiments with a tethered recoiling mechanism illustrate the usefulness of the TC algorithm.},
