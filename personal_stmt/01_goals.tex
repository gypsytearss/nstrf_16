My intention to pursue a PhD in computer science is driven by various and different experiences in life which have all played part in forming my belief in the ability of technology to enhance peoples' lives in countless ways. As such, my primary goal as a future researcher is to contribute toward solutions to the most important problems and questions facing our society. Also, because I believe that nothing good is fully experienced until it is shared with others, I aim to educate and inspire others just as I have been fortunate enough to continually be surrounded by those who've helped and inspired me. 

% I'm confident that throughout my studies, my combined interests will continue to play an active role. I believe my interest in finance and economics will continue to allow me to envision the ``big picture''; aiding me in understanding which specific projects will have the highest potential to achieve my desire to benefit others in their daily lives. \textbf{I want to continue to educate and mentor others which I will continue to achieve by mentoring undergraduate students through the Aresty Research Assistant program at Rutgers University and through our lab's continued participation in challenges such as the Amazon Picking Challenge.} Owing a large part of my accomplishments to the open and collaborative community within computer science as a whole, \textbf{I will continue to show my gratitude by open-sourcing any software I develop which may be beneficial to others within the community.} Finally, a major long term motivating factor of my decision to pursue graduate studies is to develop my own expertise across disciplines in order to have a role in determining the ``Philosophy of AI'': \textbf{using my expertise to direct the field and motivate others to pursue discoveries that will be truly meaningful and beneficial.}

I believe that I have an established track record of excelling both inside and outside of academia, an aptitude in mathematics that has certainly biased my path towards my current trajectory, and a passion for solving problems that contain the possibility of truly influencing people's lives in a meaningful way. Two broad classes of problems which I believe wholeheartedly to belong to that set are those of (1) space and planetary exploration, and (2) robotics and machine learning. The former of which is of critical importance to furthering our understanding and exploring possibilities beyond our own planet, and the latter which has shown exponential growth in terms of progress and its role in our everyday lives. I can think of no more important, prudent, and challenging area to work than at the intersection of the two. 

% At age 12 in the summer of 2000, I began coding for a local web design start-up in Fresno, California. Our main clientele were small and medium-sized businesses, for whom we developed eCommerce platforms. In 2002, the founders of the company went their separate ways after graduating college and I set out on my own by building custom computers and offering them at a discount to market prices. During this time, I found great satisfaction in the projects themselves and in the enjoyment and utility the finished product brought to people. \textbf{These experiences served as the basis for my desire to use technology to enhance individuals' businesses and livelihoods.}
